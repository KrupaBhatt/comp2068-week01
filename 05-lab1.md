# Lab 1 - Getting Started with Github

This lab is to introduce you to Github's markdown language as well as give me a quick assessment of today's class, the IT industry's current standard for Source Control and team collaboration. To complete the lab:

1.  Create a new repository called Lab 1
1.  Create a new file called `##lab1.md` but replace `##` with your initials
1.  Open a browser tab to [Markdown Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to refer to when you need to.
1.  Type the following markdown code into your empty .md file
    ![markdown template](./images/md.PNG)
1.  Using the above as a template, use markdown (not HTML tags) to fill in the 2nd question of whatever you learned today in the form of a quiz question
    * Include similar code fencing by using markdown's triple backticks followed by the name of the language you're using to better illustrate your quiz question
    * Include the answer in the form of an h2 heading followed by a brief explanation of the answer
1.  Figure out how to include some emojis too :smiley:
1.  Upload your .md file to Github and submit your Lab1 repository link on Blackboard

# 2 Things I Learned in the Form of Quiz Questions

1.  Is the following code synchronous or asynchronous?

    ```js
    var food = fs.readFile('food.txt', 'utf8', function(err, food) {
      if (err) {
        console.log(err);
      } else {
        console.log(food);
      }
    });
    ```

    ## Answer: asynchronous because it uses a callback function
