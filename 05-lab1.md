# 2 Things I Learned in the Form of Quiz Questions

1.  Is the following code synchronous or asynchronous?

    ```js
    var food = fs.readFile('food.txt', 'utf8', function(err, food) {
      if (err) {
        console.log(err);
      } else {
        console.log(food);
      }
    });
    ```

    ## Answer: asynchronous because it uses a callback function

1.  [Insert your 2nd question here]

    ```js
